# Comparative Analysis of Sorting Algorithm Performance in Java

## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of six fundamental sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort) implemented in Java. Through systematic benchmarking across multiple data configurations and input sizes, we validate theoretical complexity predictions and provide practical performance insights for algorithm selection in production environments.

Our analysis of 180 performance measurements reveals significant performance differences across algorithms and data types, with empirical results closely matching theoretical complexity expectations. The research provides data-driven recommendations for algorithm selection based on specific use case requirements.
