# Daily Project Log

## Day 1 - Project Foundation (August 20, 2025)

### Completed Tasks
- [x] VS Code environment setup with Java extensions
- [x] Maven project structure creation
- [x] Git repository initialization
- [x] PerformanceMetrics class implementation
- [x] SortingAlgorithm interface design
- [x] BenchmarkUtils utility class
- [x] Project documentation setup

### Key Achievements
- Professional development environment configured
- Core infrastructure classes implemented
- Version control established with initial commit
- Foundation ready for algorithm implementation

### Next Steps (Day 2)
- Implement first three sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
- Create comprehensive unit tests
- Validate algorithm correctness

### Notes
- Fixed seed (42) used for reproducible random number generation
- Thread-safe operation counting implemented for future parallel processing
- Memory measurement includes garbage collection for accuracy

## Day 2 - Algorithm Implementation (August 22, 2025)

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Bubble Sort implementation with early termination
- [x] Selection Sort implementation with consistent performance
- [x] Insertion Sort implementation with adaptive behavior
- [x] Comprehensive unit testing (24 tests total)
- [x] Operation counting integration
- [x] Algorithm correctness validation
- [x] Performance characteristic verification

### Key Achievements
- Three working sorting algorithms with O(n²) complexity
- Complete test coverage with edge cases
- BenchmarkUtils integration for performance tracking
- Professional JavaDoc documentation
- Verified algorithm properties (stability, in-place sorting)

### Performance Observations
- Bubble Sort: Early termination helps with sorted arrays
- Selection Sort: Consistent O(n²) regardless of input
- Insertion Sort: Excellent performance on nearly sorted data

### Next Steps (Day 3)
- Implement advanced algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort)
- Add recursive algorithm implementations
- Create more sophisticated test cases

### Statistics
- Lines of Code: ~600
- Test Cases: 24
- Test Coverage: 100% pass rate
- Commit Count: 2
