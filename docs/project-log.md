## Day 3 - Advanced Algorithm Implementation (August 23, 2025)

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Quick Sort with median-of-three pivot selection
- [x] Merge Sort with stable divide-and-conquer approach
- [x] Heap Sort with binary heap data structure
- [x] Comprehensive unit testing (18 additional tests)
- [x] Integration testing and algorithm comparison
- [x] Performance analysis across different input types

### Key Achievements
- Three O(n log n) algorithms implemented with advanced optimizations
- Quick Sort median-of-three prevents worst-case O(n²) performance
- Merge Sort maintains stability and predictable performance
- Heap Sort provides in-place O(n log n) sorting
- Complete test coverage including edge cases and performance analysis
- Algorithm comparison framework for benchmarking

### Technical Insights
- **Quick Sort**: Excellent average performance, vulnerable to poor pivot selection
- **Merge Sort**: Consistent O(n log n), stable, but requires O(n) extra space
- **Heap Sort**: Guaranteed O(n log n), in-place, but not stable
- **Optimization**: Median-of-three significantly improves Quick Sort on sorted data
- **Stability**: Critical for maintaining data integrity in real applications

### Performance Observations
- Quick Sort fastest on random data due to cache efficiency
- Merge Sort most consistent across all input types
- Heap Sort balanced performance with minimal memory usage
- All algorithms correctly handle edge cases and large datasets

### Next Steps (Day 4)
- Implement professional benchmarking framework
- Add JVM warmup and statistical measurement
- Create data generation utilities for comprehensive testing
- Design automated testing pipeline

### Statistics
- Total Algorithms: 6 (3 O(n²) + 3 O(n log n))
- Total Test Cases: 42
- Lines of Code: ~1,200
- Test Coverage: 100% pass rate
- Advanced Features: Recursion, divide-and-conquer, heap operations
